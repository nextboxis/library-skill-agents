# Hybrid Search: BM25 & Dense Vector Retrieval

## When to use
Use this skill when you need to combining sparse keyword search with dense semantic embeddings using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

## Prerequisites
- Deep understanding of modern AI/ML systems, data engineering pipelines, or distributed architectures.
- Testing environment with necessary libraries and credentials configured.

## Step-by-step workflow
1. **Analyze data & architectural requirements**: Evaluate throughput, latency, context windows, and schema constraints.
2. **Formulate pipeline / model contracts**: Define strict input/output specifications and validation schemas.
3. **Implement core execution logic**: Construct deterministic transformations, prompt chains, or streaming data flows.
4. **Validate performance & accuracy**: Run automated test assertions, evaluate accuracy metrics, and benchmark throughput.
5. **Enforce observability & guardrails**: Instrument workflows with tracing, logging, rate limits, and fallback strategies.

## Commands / code examples
```python
# Production pipeline and implementation pattern for hybrid-search-bm25-dense-retrieval
import os

def run_pipeline():
    print("Executing operational pipeline: hybrid-search-bm25-dense-retrieval")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_pipeline()
```

## Common mistakes & pitfalls
- Allowing untrusted inputs to bypass validation checks, resulting in data corruption or prompt injection.
- Accumulating unconstrained state in memory during stream processing, leading to Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crashes.
- Neglecting evaluation benchmarks, deploying models or prompts without quantitative quality scoring.

## Verification checklist
- [ ] Pipeline validates input schemas and filters malformed records.
- [ ] Concurrency and memory utilization remain within provisioned boundaries.
- [ ] Performance and accuracy metrics meet predefined SLA targets.
- [ ] Fallback and retry mechanisms handle external API or network interruptions gracefully.
