# Docker Compose Multi-Container Orchestration

## When to use
Use this skill when you need to defining multi-container development environments, networking, volumes, and health checks using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites
- Deep understanding of systems architecture, networking protocols, or cloud platforms.
- Administrative access to relevant cloud console, CLI tools, or network testing lab.

## Step-by-step workflow
1. **Analyze infrastructure topology**: Assess existing network boundaries, compute instances, and routing policies.
2. **Draft configuration specifications**: Formulate declarative configurations adhering strictly to the principle of least privilege.
3. **Execute controlled deployment**: Apply changes through version-controlled pipelines or staged canary rollouts.
4. **Inspect telemetry and traffic**: Verify correct operation using protocol dissectors, status commands, or log queries.
5. **Establish automated guardrails**: Configure automated health probes, alerts, and drift detection monitors.

## Commands / code examples
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - REDIS_URL=redis://cache:6379
    depends_on:
      cache:
        condition: service_healthy

  cache:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 5
```

## Common mistakes & pitfalls
- Exposing internal administrative interfaces directly to public subnets without bastion hosts or zero-trust gates.
- Relying on manual CLI modifications rather than version-controlled Infrastructure as Code.
- Neglecting to configure automated health checks and failover triggers on critical traffic paths.

## Verification checklist
- [ ] Configurations follow least-privilege access and zero-trust principles.
- [ ] Infrastructure definitions are stored in version control with automated CI/CD checks.
- [ ] Health checks, monitoring metrics, and alert policies are active.
- [ ] Network paths and routing rules are verified using diagnostic utilities.
